# Bharat-Intern-Projects
This repository contains a collection of machine learning and data science projects completed as part of my internship with Bharat Intern. All projects were developed remotely during my internship, providing hands-on experience with real-world datasets and practical machine learning techniques.

## About the Internship
During my internship with Bharat Intern, I had the opportunity to work on diverse machine learning projects from home. Each project challenged me to apply core concepts in data analysis, model building, and algorithm implementation, strengthening my skills in Python and popular data science libraries.

## Projects Included
### 1. House Price Prediction (House Price Prediction.ipynb)
#### Algorithm: Multiple Linear Regression
Predicts house prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and location. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation, helping users estimate property values accurately.

### 2. Iris Flower Classification (Iris Flower Classification.ipynb)
#### Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Classifies iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using SVM. The notebook covers data visualization, model building, and prediction on new samples using classic features like sepal and petal dimensions.

### 3. Movie Recommendation System (Movie Recommendation System.ipynb)
#### Algorithm: Cosine Similarity (Content-Based Filtering)
Implements a content-based movie recommendation system using cosine similarity. The system analyzes movie features to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.

## Conclusion
Bharat-Intern-Projects showcases my practical experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems during my internship with Bharat Intern. These projects reflect my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to deliver data-driven solutions independently in a remote setting. If you are interested in implementing similar projects, customizing machine learning solutions for your organization, or collaborating on data science initiatives, I would be glad to connect. I am open to discussions, partnerships, and freelance opportunities to help bring innovative analytics and automation to your workflows.
